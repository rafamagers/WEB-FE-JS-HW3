        <!-- Section for JavaScript Async -->
        <section>
            <h2>1. JavaScript Async</h2>
            <p>
                JavaScript is inherently single-threaded, which means it can only execute one task at a time. However, modern applications require handling multiple operations simultaneously, such as fetching data from a server, interacting with the DOM, and performing calculations. This is where asynchronous programming comes into play.
            </p>
            <p>
                Asynchronous programming allows JavaScript to perform long-running tasks without blocking the main thread. Instead of waiting for an operation to complete, the program can continue executing other tasks, and the async operation will notify the program once it is finished.
            </p>
            <pre><code>// Example of async operation
console.log("Start");
setTimeout(() => console.log("Async operation"), 1000); // Delays the operation by 1 second
console.log("End");

// Output:
// Start
// End
// Async operation (after 1 second)
            </code></pre>
        </section>

        <!-- Section for Callback -->
        <section>
            <h2>2. Callback</h2>
            <p>
                A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function and executed after the completion of the original function. Callbacks are a fundamental concept in JavaScript, especially in asynchronous programming.
            </p>
            <p>
                While callbacks provide a way to handle async operations, they can lead to "callback hell" or deeply nested callbacks, making the code harder to read and maintain.
            </p>
            <pre><code>// Example of a callback function
function downloadFile(url, callback) {
    console.log("Downloading file from " + url);
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("File downloaded");
        callback();
    }, 2000);
}

function processFile() {
    console.log("Processing the downloaded file");
}

downloadFile("https://example.com/file", processFile);

// Output:
// Downloading file from https://example.com/file
// File downloaded (after 2 seconds)
// Processing the downloaded file
            </code></pre>
        </section>

        <!-- Section for Promise -->
        <section>
            <h2>3. Promise</h2>
            <p>
                A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. Promises provide a cleaner and more robust way to handle async operations compared to callbacks, avoiding the nesting issue.
            </p>
            <p>
                A Promise has three states:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pending:</strong> The initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fulfilled:</strong> The operation completed successfully.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rejected:</strong> The operation failed.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Promises are chainable using <code>.then()</code> and <code>.catch()</code> methods, making them more readable than callbacks.
            </p>
            <pre><code>// Example of a Promise
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let success = true;
    setTimeout(() => {
        if(success) {
            resolve("Operation successful!");
        } else {
            reject("Operation failed!");
        }
    }, 2000);
});

promise.then(result => console.log(result))  // If resolved
       .catch(error => console.log(error));  // If rejected

// Output (after 2 seconds):
// Operation successful!
            </code></pre>
        </section>

        <!-- Section for Async/Await -->
        <section>
            <h2>4. Async/Await</h2>
            <p>
                Async/Await is syntactic sugar built on top of Promises, allowing us to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous-looking manner. The <code>async</code> keyword is used to declare a function that returns a Promise, while <code>await</code> is used to pause the execution until the Promise is resolved or rejected.
            </p>
            <p>
                Async/Await makes the code more readable and easier to follow, especially when dealing with multiple async operations.
            </p>
            <pre><code>// Example of Async/Await
async function fetchData() {
    try {
        let response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1");
        let data = await response.json();
        console.log("Data received:", data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.log("Error:", error);
    }
}

fetchData();

// Output (after fetching data):
// Data received: { userId: 1, id: 1, title: "Example title", ... }
            </code></pre>
        </section>

        <!-- Section for Event Loop -->
        <section>
            <h2>5. Event Loop</h2>
            <p>
                The Event Loop is a crucial part of JavaScript's runtime model, responsible for handling asynchronous operations. JavaScript has a call stack where it pushes and executes functions. When an asynchronous operation is encountered, such as a callback or a promise, it is pushed to the task queue and handled by the event loop.
            </p>
            <p>
                The event loop continuously checks if the call stack is empty. If it is, it takes the first task from the task queue and pushes it onto the call stack for execution. This process allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations efficiently without blocking the main thread.
            </p>
            <pre><code>// Example of Event Loop
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Callback");
}, 0);

console.log("End");

// Output:
// Start
// End
// Callback (executed after the stack is cleared)
